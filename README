quickTwit

The first "quick" twitter status updater.

I came up with this app idea after a night of drinking and trying to send tweets using Twitter's 40404 shortcode. I wanted an easier way to send out a tweet, so you could say quickTwit is the bastard child of a night of binge drinking.

Originally started as just a status updater, quickTwit was expanded rapidly to support Facebook statuses via Ping.fm, Photos via TwitPic, and preset messages.

quickTwit is my personal favorite app, and I'm enjoying the same concept on my iPhone with qTweeter... an idea to this day I say they stole from me.
